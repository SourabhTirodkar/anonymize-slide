1.Setting up Anaconda Environment

Commands:
a. conda create --name py2 python=2.7
b. activate py2
c. conda install nb_conda

If the environment was activated successfully, you should see (py2- name used here) at the beggining of the command prompt. This will set the kernel as your default kernel when running the code.
